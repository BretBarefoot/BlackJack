# BlackJack
First Project I have worked on since career change to what I have always wanted to do....PROGRAM!
This is going to be just a little fun and my first addition to my portfolio.  
Hope you enjoy the game!

This game will deal you a hand, let you bet, keeps track of your current winnings, and is just a very fun game of blackjack.
I think I have the majority of it working correctly.  There may be one or two end cases I havent tested.  I created this when I first starting learning about OOP so its
probably not the neatest thing ever written but I tried to make the main very smooth.  Some of my functions may be a little bulky but I was happy with myself on this one.
I started using comments on this app and I am getting better at it.  I think one thing I could do is have a save feature that writes to a file and reads back from the file when you
want to resume your game.  That would probably be the next step in my blackjack game.


Thanks,
